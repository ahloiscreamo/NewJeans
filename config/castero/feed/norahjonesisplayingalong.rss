      <link>https://www.norahjonesisplayingalong.com/brian-blade</link>
      <description>Brian Blade is a world renowned drummer hailing from Shreveport, Louisiana. In addition to his own group, Brian Blade Fellowship, he’s played with the likes of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea and Norah amongst many others. He is also a composer and songwriter and can be found carrying a guitar on tour in case the spark for new music strikes. Brian &amp; Norah discuss his penchant for listening to the lyrics while he plays and gets a better understanding for where he developed his fluid style. They put this to the test while playing some of Norah's songs and then switch up the instrumentation with Brian on guitar for a few of his songs from his band, Mama Rosa, including ‘At The Centerline’ and ‘Nature’s Law.’ So tune in as Norah dares to play drums for her drummer! Recorded on 3/6/22.

      <title>Chris Thile</title>
      <link>https://www.norahjonesisplayingalong.com/chris-thile</link>
      <description>Chris Thile was born to play music! He began playing the mandolin at 5 years old and by 8 was in the popular bluegrass band, Nickel Creek. He went on to start the band Punch Brothers and to take the reins of Prairie Home Companion and reinvent it as his own ‘Live from Here with Chris Thile’. The conversation dives into what it was like growing up in church, making room for healthy debates, and the life-changing experience of having Alison Krauss as your producer. This episode is a wild card when it comes to music, as Chris suggests that he and Norah not only dig into his catalog, but also play some killer songs by Radiohead and Judee Sill. Recorded on 10/26/2021

      <description>Marc Rebillet is a wizard! You may know him as Loop Daddy or from his many viral videos improvising tracks at home in his bathrobe. And while that might not be Norah’s performance attire, she and Marc do have a lot in common sharing roots from Dallas to New York. This is by far the funkiest episode to date as Norah &amp; Marc lay down original music on the spot while discussing childhood influences, Marc’s main inspiration Reggie Watts, and how he pieces together the music magic. Tune in to find out what he has planned next!

      <itunes:summary>Marc Rebillet is a wizard! You may know him as Loop Daddy or from his many viral videos improvising tracks at home in his bathrobe. And while that might not be Norah’s performance attire, she and Marc do have a lot in common sharing roots from Dallas to New York. This is by far the funkiest episode to date as Norah &amp; Marc lay down original music on the spot while discussing childhood influences, Marc’s main inspiration Reggie Watts, and how he pieces together the music magic. Tune in to find out what he has planned next!

      <link>https://www.norahjonesisplayingalong.com/tarriona-tank-ball</link>
      <description>Tarriona “Tank” Ball is the front woman of Tank and the Bangas who got her start in the slam poetry scene of New Orleans. Norah and Tank are by all means ‘friend goals’ so they cover everything from the news, to cooking, writing, attending the GRAMMYs and of course love. The music in this episode takes some surprising turns while they play new versions of songs by Tank like ‘Rollercoasters’ &amp; ‘Friend Goals,’ a collaboration with Norah titled ‘Playing Along’ and in a twist, a new take on ‘Don’t Know Why.’ Recorded on 9/16/2021

      <title>Jeff Tweedy</title>
      <link>http://norahjonesisplayingalong.com/jeff-tweedy</link>
      <description>Jeff Tweedy is a musician, songwriter, author and frontman of the prolific band, Wilco. Norah joins Jeff in the studio to chat and play duo versions of 5 of her favorites songs of his, including ‘Jesus, Etc.,’ ‘Muzzle of Bees’ and ‘Sunken Treasure’. They dive into how he’s made music a family pastime and writing the perfect set list. Norah &amp; Jeff laugh about the time she got the words wrong to one of his most beloved songs in front of him, and they tackle the age-old question of ‘who’s career would you like to have?’ They revisit recent history and discuss how the pandemic impacted songwriting. In the end, the answer is simple: Love is the king! Recorded on 10/1/2021
